# Auth0 assignment task
## Install
- `npm install`

## Run server and client
from root directory
- `npm run server`
- `npm run client`

## Following commands to run from server/client folders
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`

## Follow up section - what I would improve if it would go on production
### General
- different configs for prod/dev environment for contentful client or url on the client side to get platforms
- better API error handling and play more around more verbose status codes + messages
- error handling on the front-end for non 200 codes from API
- logs + metrics to monitor API requests
- use css modules for stylus to scope class names locally
- better cross browser testing, I checked safari, chrome, firefox new versions only and simulators for mobile, tablet and real iphone device
- better test coverage

### Server side rendering
- to optimize web page for SEO and performance (e.g: First interaction time) add server side rendering
- e.g: use react on the server and hydrate components on the front-end. Hydrate attaches events handlers to the existing markup generated by server.

### Login
- on the server add a verification of access token if the user is logged in to process favourite platforms
ref: https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/tutorials/verify-access-token
- could be implemented as middleware
ref: https://decembersoft.com/posts/authenticating-a-session-cookie-in-express-middleware-with-jsonwebtoken/
- persist login session after refresh the page, save access token as a cookie to read only with the server, use authorization code to exchange code for access token
ref: https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/grant/authorization-code

### Contentful client
- locale is hardcoded which could be handled via Api requests
- ACCESS_TOKEN for contentful is a secret, shouldn't be hardcoded in the code, use e.g: dotenv + heroku config vars, credstash

### Cache
- currently get platforms is using only node-cache which is the cache in memory. If the app would need a better hit rate something like redis (centralized) cache could be used.
